## What is Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings?

Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings is a new framework for building mobile apps using C# and .NET. Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings uses Razor syntax to define UI components and behaviors of an application. The underlying UI components are based on Xamarin.Forms elements.

This is a sample `Hello, World!` component:

```xml
<ContentPage>
    <StackLayout>

        <Label Text="Hello, World!"
               FontSize="20"
               HorizontalTextAlignment="TextAlignment.Center" />

    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```
